<p>
PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32
platforms, along with an <code>xterm</code> terminal emulator. It is
written and maintained primarily by
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~anakin/">Simon Tatham</a>.

<p>
The latest version is beta 0.53b.

<p><b>LEGAL WARNING</b>:
Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where
encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP,
PSFTP and Plink in England and many other countries, but I am not a
lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before
downloading it. You may find
<a href="http://rechten.kub.nl/koops/cryptolaw/index.htm">this site</a>
useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I
can't vouch for its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any
cryptography laws.

<b>2002-04-27 Too much e-mail to answer</b>

<p>
The volume of e-mail from PuTTY users has finally overwhelmed the
development team. There is now literally more mail coming in than we
can answer. Even with four of us, and even with the FAQ fielding all
the most common questions. There's just too much.

<p>
We will still <em>try</em> to reply to questions,
feature suggestions and bug reports we receive, but we can't promise
to do so. We simply don't have enough time to reply to them all, and
if we did we'd never manage to do any actual coding. <em>Please</em>
try to be thoughtful, and don't send us mail unless you really can't
find <em>anyone</em> else to answer your question. The newsgroup
<code>comp.security.ssh</code> might be a good place to try with
support questions.
