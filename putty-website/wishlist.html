<p>
This is the list of bugs that need fixing, and features that want
adding, to PuTTY. This list represents things that have not been
done to the current <em>development</em> code. If you do not see a
feature here, it's worth checking the
<a href="changes.html">Changes page</a>
before mailing us to ask for the feature; we might have already
added it since the last release.

<a name="bugs"><h2>Bugs</h2></a>

<p>
These items are clearly actual problems and I want them fixed.

<ul>

<li>
Fatal error handling is patchy and flaky. It's very easy to throw a
fatal error, put up a message box, and then receive a Windows
message containing yet more socket data. The MessageBox message loop
then dispatches that message automatically and the back end is
called reentrantly. Chaos ensues. Solution: the fatal error
behaviour should be much more robust. Close <em>all</em> sockets the
instant a fatal error occurs; also set some global flags that
prevent action messages from having any back end effect.

<li>
If there is data being transferred through PuTTY while the SSH2
repeat key exchange is taking place, it can confuse some servers.
As far as I'm aware nobody has properly standardised this aspect of
the SSH2 protocol (what happens to the connection layer while the
transport layer is in a key exchange phase?) so it isn't clear what
PuTTY <em>should</em> do in this situation, but a good
conservative/liberal option would be to accept incoming
connection-layer packets provided we can decrypt them, and to queue
outgoing connection-layer packets until the key exchange is
completed. I can't easily imagine a standards decision that would
invalidate that behaviour.

<li>
Problems with various keyboard layouts. It would be hard for me to
debug these myself because I'd have to be able to work in the same
keymap as I was testing PuTTY in! If anybody can debug these
problems it would be greatly appreciated.
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="http://www.users.one.se/liket/svorak/">svorak</a> (Swedish
Dvorak) layout apparently gets a few control combinations wrong: ^W,
^V and ^Z.
<li>
On the Danish keyboard, apparently the tilde (~) is acting as a dead
key <em>and</em> generating a code in itself; so if you hit ~ and
then n, you get a ~ followed by a &ntilde;.
<li>
There's been a report from a Korean user that Korean multi-byte
input doesn't work.
<li>
A German user has reported that Caps Lock is more like Shift Lock -
it affects a lot of keys other than alphabetics.
</ul>

<li>
If PuTTY starts up with its window unselected, something slightly
odd can happen with the cursor: it doesn't revert from box to block
when the window gains focus.

<li>
DNS lookups are synchronous. We could make them async quite easily,
which would stop the last potential delay before the PuTTY window
appears and would also prevent an absent DNS server from hanging
PuTTY while a remote-to-local port forwarding times out on DNS; but
ideally I'd like an abstraction of DNS so that we can still port
later (since the socket API only has synchronous DNS). Porting to
Unix will be fine (we can use adns), and any thread-capable OS won't
have a problem. Everything else will just have to degrade gracefully
to synchronous DNS, which will be fun. :-(

<li>
There's a two-pronged problem with fonts whose characters overlap
outside their designated rectangular cell.
<ul>
<li>
Firstly, we don't deal
well with this. Each <em>string</em> passed to
<code>do_text()</code> is clipped to the rectangle it should be in;
but <em>within</em> that string there's still scope for overlap
between character cells. If half the string is then updated then
there will be artefacts left on the screen; I can't see any obvious
fix except to always draw one character at a time, which is just
ghastly.
<li>
Secondly, the resize-by-changing-font code has a tendency to choose
fonts that cause this problem a lot. For bitmap fonts I think this
is just a hazard of the job - if you ask PuTTY to resize a non-
resizeable font, you can expect it to do a shoddy job at best - but
it even happens slightly in Courier New (the very RH edge of the
lower case m sometimes protrudes into the next character cell),
which really isn't on. Sadly I have no idea how we can fix this in
general - if we ask for a smaller width than we really want, then
(a) we penalise well-behaved fonts, and (b) the spacing when drawing
a large string will come out wrong.
</ul>

<li>
Resizing the window is still pretty flaky. One particular current
problem is: if you choose a font that fits 80 columns on your screen
but not 132, then sending ESC[?3h to switch to 132-column mode will
squish the font just enough to fit 132 columns in a full-width
window. So far so good; but when you send ESC[?3l to return to 80
columns, really it would be nice if the window was put back the way
it started out. Also there's some indication that the squishing
doesn't work quite right; first PuTTY expands the window to full
width, then it chooses a font size, and then it leaves a big border
down each side of the window when that font size fails to fit quite
right. Really it should recompute the window size once it knows the
font size.

</ul>

<h2>Semi-bugs</h2>

<p>
These are things which might be bugs or might not, depending on your
precise definition of what a bug is.

<ul>

<li>
PSCP ought to handle really really big (&gt;2Gb) files. There's been
a report that it doesn't do so properly. (Apparently this will only
be meaningful under an NT-series OS; the 95 series inherently can't
handle more than 2Gb in any case.)

<li>
Better handling of the connection closing, and of SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT
being received. Ideally we should maintain our own idea of when and
whether we <em>expect</em> to see a closure, and only signal clean
exit when a closure or disconnect arrives that we were expecting. If
one arrives unexpectedly it should count as an ungraceful closure,
display a dialog box containing the text out of MSG_DISCONNECT, and
not close the window unless the user selected "Always".

<li>
Opaque resizes under NT cause trouble when the user changes their
mind and carefully drags the window back to the way it started out:
the contents of the screen have been trashed and no resize event is
sent to the server. Perhaps redisplay during resizing should be
reimplemented in a way that doesn't change the terminal buffer's
size at all.

<li>
Port forwarding upgrade: it would be nice to be able to (at least
try to) reconfigure forwardings in Change Settings.

<li>
Interesting port forwarding feature: someone suggested that being
able to choose <em>which</em> loopback address to bind to might be a
useful feature (so that you could have separate forwardings
listening on the same port of 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and so
on). The UI for this would probably work by specifying the address
alongside the port number (bind local port 127.0.0.2:3456 instead of
just 3456).

<li>
Apparently PuTTY doesn't correctly handle switching Windows keymaps
in mid-session: the keymap in force when PuTTY starts up remains in
force throughout. I have no idea what you have to do to fix this, so
someone else will have to help me if it's ever going to be fixed.

<li>
Window placement is non-ideal. PuTTY creates a "guess" window of
arbitrary size and then measures the difference between its full and
client-area sizes; this allows it to precisely calculate the correct
<em>real</em> size, and resize the window. Sadly this scuppers
Windows's default-placement scheme. Unsure what should be done about
this, but clearly something should.

<li>
It is claimed that MapVirtualKeyEx and ToAsciiEx don't work in
Korean Win98 (although they're fine in other Korean Windows
products); MapVirtualKey and ToAscii work fine. If anyone can
reproduce this problem and work out a way for PuTTY to determine
which pair of functions to use on any given system, that would be
useful.

<li>
I have no idea whatsoever what the Unicode handling does about
Hebrew and other right-to-left scripts. I have equally little idea
what it <em>should</em> do. If someone who knows about these things
could at least let me know of the answers to those questions, that
would be a good start.

</ul>

<a name="wishlist"><h2>Plausible feature wish list</h2></a>

<p>
This list contains features I hope to get round to adding at some
stage.

<ul>

<li>
When you adjust the properties of a running session using the
"Change Settings" menu option, it might be nice to be able to save
the adjusted settings back to the saved-session slot you loaded
from, or to a new session slot. This feature is one of the most
requested, but is currently pending some design work:
<ul>
<li>
If you load an existing saved session exactly "as is", by
double-clicking or by running "<code>putty @sessionname</code>" or
whatever, it's reasonably obvious that hitting the Save button in
mid-session should write the changed details back to the same slot
you loaded from.
<li>
What if you loaded the session, modified a setting or two, and
<em>then</em> started it? Should a mid-session Save still write back
to the original slot by default? It sounds as if it obviously
should ... but what if the one setting you changed was the
<em>hostname</em>? Suddenly I think it's no longer completely
obvious that you should be conveniently able to overwrite your
previous saved session with the new one.
<li>
So the user interface for this feature needs some serious thought;
we have to have a means for working out precisely when it does and
does not make sense to have an automatic
save-to-where-we-loaded-from button available.
</ul>

<li>
You should be able to specify <em>only</em> the SSH 2 protocol, i.e.
have a mode in which PuTTY will refuse to connect rather than
degrade to SSH 1. (For symmetry, perhaps vice versa as well,
although I can't see an obvious use for it.)

<li>
An extra bell option that uses the PC speaker. I'm sure I remember
reading once that you could access this using
MessageBeep(0xFFFFFFFF), but when I tried that on Win2k it played
the Windows Default Sound just like MB_OK. Anyone who knows how this
is really done is welcome to let me know...

<li>
PSCP should allow cipher selection by other means than loading a
PuTTY saved session.

<li>
PSCP should allow a user option to specify the Unix file permissions
on files created at the remote end.

<li>
Now that PSCP supports SFTP as a back end, perhaps we should
implement the reget/reput functionality with an extra command line
option. Of course it would fail in an SCP1-type connection.

<li>
Pageant should offer a wider range of passphrase and key management
options.
<ul>
<li>
It should be possible to expire the passphrase on a key after a
specified time, and also to load a key but defer requesting the
passphrase until the key is first used.
<li>
Perhaps it should be possible for Pageant to remember the keys it
has loaded and automatically reload them on restart.
<li>
It would also be nice to be able to invoke a second Pageant with a
special command line, and have it delete keys from the main one or
shut it down.
<li>
When loading more than one key in immediate succession, it might be
nice to cache passphrases at least for the duration of that run, in
case two keys have the same one.
</ul>

<li>
Perhaps, for people who don't like dialog boxes, messages like
"connection closed" and fatal errors should be configurable to
appear inside the window instead of popping up sudden message boxes.
If we do this, we should probably include a means of distinguishing
that sort of error output from <em>anything</em> the remote site can
possibly send.

<li>
Perhaps Shift-Backspace could do whichever of ^H and ^? normal
Backspace <em>isn't</em> doing. Apart from anything else this would make
documentation of the Backspace functionality switch easier (we could
invite users to try Shift-Backspace if just Backspace doesn't work,
and this would be a clear indication that they needed to frob that
switch).

<li>
PuTTY should do something sensible if the user key it's given in the
configuration matches one of the ones in Pageant. (In particular, if
it tries the one in Pageant and the server refuses it, it shouldn't
then try it again.)

<li>
When doing a local-to-remote copy using PSCP, perhaps it could check
the source filespec <em>before</em> attempting to connect to the
host. That would save time and effort by notifying the user of a
typo sooner than otherwise.

<li>
When selecting with the mouse, it might make sense for further
incoming data to be buffered until the user lets go, so that they
aren't trying to work with a moving target. This might also be nice
when scrolling with the scrollbar.

<li>
Allow the "ANSI Green" used for foregrounds to be different from the
one used for backgrounds (for all values of "Green").

<li>
Terminal settings that are modifiable from "Change Settings" but
which only control an <em>initial</em> state should be handled
better. Perhaps a sensible procedure would be that if the user
changes such a setting, then when they hit Apply they get a message
box: "You have modified the initial state of the Foo setting. This
change will take effect the next time your terminal is reset. Do you
want to force it to take effect immediately as well? [yes] [no]".

<li>
Perhaps an inactive window should have a menu option to reactivate
the session (like Duplicate Session but in the same window).

<li>
A second font selection for 132-column mode. Perhaps, in general,
the ability to select multiple fonts and switch between them quickly?

<li>
Ability to configure font quality (the fdwQuality parameter to
CreateFont). Choices should include "antialiased",
"non-antialiased", "ClearType", "default".

<li>
There have been various requests to have various config options
available conveniently in the System menu instead of having to go
all the way to Change Settings. A particularly common request is the
ability to turn logging on and off quickly.

<li>
PSCP should be able to send its log messages to stdout instead of
stderr, since Windows doesn't provide any easy way to redirect
stderr.

<li>
Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn to scroll by one line at a time.

<li>
Command line options, in general. In particular, SSH protocol,
cipher and compression selection in the auxiliary utilities (PSCP
etc). The command-line utilities should also be able to specify an
identity file using the standard option, because this might enable
the WinCVS GUI identity-file chooser to work with Plink.

<li>
Users from countries (is it <em>only</em> the US?) that don't need
the AltGr key might like to have an option that makes it work the
same way as the left Alt key.

<li>
Allow saving of the current screen+scrollback state to a file. Or
printing it, possibly.

<li>
One user suggested a search facility for finding text in the
scrollback. Full-blown regexp-style grep is probably overkill, but a
Notepad-esque search box (select up/down search direction, select
case sensitivity, type your text and go) might be feasible.

<li>
It might be generous if we skipped whitespace when parsing IP
addresses in the Host Name box.

<li>
<i>Possibly</i> copy/paste should be implicit in the mouse only within
one window. Not convinced. Certainly the current behaviour would be
available by configuration (and probably still the default too).

<li>
Extra features in pasting. Perhaps PuTTY could somehow remember
which on-screen spaces had been output as the result of a tab
character, and which were genuine spaces, and reproduce that when
copying to the clipboard. Likewise, perhaps, trailing spaces. Also,
since we now allow RTF pasting, perhaps it could paste style
information (bold, italic etc) alongside. Probably at least some of
these features will want to be configurable off, since I can imagine
them causing trouble in some situations.

<li>
Perhaps (configurably) we could do the X trick of emulating the
middle button when both buttons are pressed, to improve X exiles'
experience of PuTTY's mouse handling.

<li>
Some means of categorising saved sessions, for people who have lots.

<li>
Someone suggested adaptive ordering in the saved session box (a new
session is placed in the middle of the list, and whenever you use a
session it moves up by one, so the commonly-used ones end up at the
top of the list). Not sure about this one at all, but it's worth at
least considering.

<li>
WM_PASTE and drag&drop support.

<li>
Possibly support OpenSSH's host key policy: file each host key under
a (hostname,IP) pair, so as to be able to deal with one hostname
mapping to a cluster of several IPs with different host keys. First
think through all the implications and work out whether we really
want to do this. Also, for the benefit of really weird network
setups, be able to explicitly <em>specify</em> what name to store a
host key under.

<li>
Remapping of keypad-Delete to ^? as an option. Also, optional
remapping of Home/End to ^A/^E. And one user wanted a user-definable
F5 sequence. And several users want the block above the arrow keys
to be mapped in the LK450 layout. Maybe a generic key remapping
facility, though that would probably be horrible to implement...

<li>
Perhaps copy and paste in the Windows style: ^C/^V or
ShiftIns/CtrlIns. (Note that we already have ShiftIns as paste, so
this would have to be a configurable option that disabled the
existing copy-on-selection.) Also, perhaps, (copy) and paste options
on the System menu, and/or the toolbar (if we add one). And, in
fact, if the user selects Windows-style copy/paste <em>instead</em>
of the X style, then the right mouse button will be free to bring up
a context menu that can have "Copy" and "Paste" options.

<li>
Make selection colours configurable rather than forcing them to be
inverse-of-current. But still need inverse-of-current as an option.
Come up with a sane UI for this and then implement it.

<li>
Allow the user to select a different default colour for underlined
text, and a different default background colour for bold text, and
so on. Not everybody wants true WYSIWYG in attribute rendering.
Also, consider the possibility of changing <em>fonts</em> for some
of these criteria (might be useful for people with low vision).

<li>
Some support for the generality of SSH 2, in the sense that it's not
necessary to start a shell; you can make a connection and just do
port forwarding, for example.

<li>
Think about pre-building a bitmap for better scrolling, or possibly
just doing the old scroll optimisations over again and getting them
<i>right</i>.

<li>
Possibly line-end conversion in pscp. An option to turn it on, an
option (enabled by default) to turn it off, and perhaps an option to
try to auto-detect whether to turn it on or not. (Anyone know a good
heuristic for distinguishing text from binary files? infozip has
one, as does less; anyone want to comment on which is better or
whether there are better still?)

<li>
Port to other OSes: Unix/X (need a local-xterm back end), BeOS
(likewise).

<li>
Perhaps a screen-clear should push the previous screen contents into
the scrollback?

<li>
Toolbar, <i>maybe</i>. Certainly optional, if so.

<li>
Optional status bar with various information on it. A visible
indicator of whether the connection is secured or not (for the
paranoids who aren't sure whether they remembered to hit the SSH
button); a display of the cursor coordinates; whether the terminal
bell is currently overloaded; some sort of visual representation of
the host key perhaps. Anything else that springs to mind.

<li>
Menu bar, to go with the toolbar. Definitely optional. Option for
cut and paste to be in the Windows style and/or via the menu/tool
bars.

<li>
The default-foreground and default-background colour selection
should have an option to go with the Windows colour scheme.

<li>
It would be nice to maintain our own terminfo/termcap description of
the terminal emulated by PuTTY, as an alternative to having PuTTY
claim to be an xterm and hoping everybody's xterms behave similarly.

<li>
Possibly more encryptions? IDEA is out due to the patent
restrictions being incompatible with the PuTTY licence; RC4 would
probably be doable if anyone actually wants it; Twofish and Serpent
would both be feasible.

<li>
Ability to select a preference order of authentications.

<li>
Ability to connect to a serial port as well as a Telnet or SSH
connection. Also, ability to run a local command interpreter in a
pipe (probably an NT-only feature).

<li>
Support for proxies. There are several types of proxy to consider:
<ul>
<li>
SOCKS.
<li>
HTTP CONNECT style proxying (connect to the HTTP port and send
something like "<code>CONNECT hostname.example.com:22
HTTP/1.0</code>", then parse the HTTP return headers and go)
<li>
Simple by-hand proxy: the kind where you telnet to the firewall and
type "<code>connect hostname.example.com 22</code>", and then expect
a connection to begin.
</ul>
We would also want the ability to define non-proxy zones (probably
give the user the choice of DNS or IP address space).

<li>
Ability to cache host keys and settings in a file as well as the
registry, so that people can (for example) easily carry a complete
PuTTY setup around on a floppy.

<li>
Ability to store PuTTY host keys and settings in HKEY_ALL_USERS as
well as HKEY_CURRENT_USER, so that sysadmins can set up a default
set of host keys (for example, all the servers in a company) to
spare some classes of user the constant "new host key" messages.
Also so that sysadmins can provide a default set of saved sessions
or local Default Settings (sensible local proxy support springs to
mind once it's implemented) but this MUST be a default only and the
user MUST be able to override all of it using settings in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

<li>
Inheritable saved sessions. The way I see this working is that you'd
have a button marked "Inherit" next to the "Load" button. Selecting
an existing saved session and clicking this would give you a
weird-looking config box in which all the features had an indicator
beside them saying they were inherited from the parent session.
Modifying any setting would clear this indicator; clicking the
indicator would set it and revert the setting to the way it is in
the parent. You could then save and launch this session in the usual
way - but if you modified a setting in the parent session which was
inherited rather than locally modified in the child, then the
child's setting would change. So, for example, you could have most
of your day-to-day sessions _inherit_ from Default Settings rather
than copying it, so if you found a nicer font you could change them
all in one go. Of course there'd be no reason an inherited session
couldn't inherit from another inherited session.

<li>
PSFTP could do with more features: options and wildcards to ls (-l
etc), and perhaps recursive transfer of whole directories like scp.
(After all, we can <em>do</em> this in SFTP already!)

<li>
Perhaps PSCP (and possibly Plink and PSFTP and other potential
command-line type tools) should be able to read some default
command-line options from an environment variable? Note that if we
did this we would also need to supply a negative form of
<em>every</em> option, so that a user could always choose to turn
off an option that the environment variable had turned on.

<li>
Scripting support, so you can have PuTTY perform automatic tasks.
(Such as remembering your password for you, although I don't
recommend this on grounds of security!)

<li>
Extract all the user-visible text to a single location, so it can be
easily replaced with a set of translations into other languages.
It's not yet clear whether we want to do this at compile time,
post-compile time, or using a Windows string resource (probably not
the latter since we will eventually be porting to non-Windows
environments).

</ul>

<h2>Implausible feature wish list</h2>

<p>
These are features I will probably never get round to adding myself.
I wouldn't be opposed to seeing them written, but if it happens
somebody else will have to do it, because they're big and
complicated and I wouldn't use them enough myself to justify
spending all that effort.

<ul>

<li>
Improved ANSI printer control support. Squirting raw data out to a
random printer is all very well for people who already have their
remote application configured with a driver for their specific
printer, but not ideal if you just want to send a text file and have
it print in a sensible sort of way. I'd like an alternative printing
mode using the Windows graphical printing API (where the printing
application has to draw on the page like a canvas), doing the layout
myself. Advantages include being able to guarantee the right number
of columns and rows per page, being able to let the user select
portrait/landscape, and possibly also doing some escape-sequence
parsing on the input data stream to handle a variety of simple
control codes (DEC/ANSI and PCL both spring to mind, and I think the
simple ones of these could both be supported at once without clashes
requiring user-level configuration).

<li>
X11 forwarding currently doesn't even attempt to authenticate with
the local X server. In order for it to do so, PuTTY would have to
know where to look for authentication data. It would be nice if this
were to happen.

<li>
A GUI SFTP client. (Possibly it should also be able to use SCP but
with massively reduced functionality.) Writing big complex GUIs is
hard work and I simply don't have the effort to spare.

<li>
SRP support, as an alternative to pure password authentication.
Possibly also in Telnet.

<li>
Zmodem file transfers.

<li>
An option in Plink to handle terminal escape codes, so that you get
"PuTTY in a console window", and so you can run it full-screen.

<li>
Somebody requested "Kerberos 5 credential forwarding". I don't know
anything about Kerberos, so if this gets done it will have to be
done by somebody who does.

<li>
Support for various international input methods. There's been a
report from the Netherlands of an "international keyboard driver"
which allows you to enter, for example, an "&Euml;" just by typing a
double quote and then an E. I believe there are also Eastern input
mechanisms we don't handle sensibly. Somebody who knows about this
stuff will have to do it for me and probably explain it to me as
well, because I just don't know enough about internationalisation.

<li>
There's been one request for SSL. (SSL/Telnet in particular;
possibly also raw-SSL in order to talk directly to HTTPS?) Most of
the SSL protocol looks reasonably sane, except for the certificates
(ASN.1 and X509 and other buzzwords). If the certificate processing
turns out to take <em>too</em> much code, SSL might not make it into
the PuTTY core for size reasons - it would have to be compiled in
specially, or perhaps shipped as a separate DLL.

<li>
A lot of people seem to want a single PuTTY to be able to manage
multiple connections. Some want an MDI-style application, with one
large main window containing several session windows; other people
want the window to stay the same size and the multiple sessions to
be selected by Alt-F1, Alt-F2 etc., or by selecting tabs on the
window. This is a <em>huge</em> amount of work, because for a start
it would need most of the code reworking to be able to deal with
more than one instance of an SSH connection or a terminal
(currently, each PuTTY connection is an entirely separate process).
In addition I'd want a strong guarantee of reliability (if one
session crashes, can it avoid taking the other nine down?). Also I'd
want to be able to configure PuTTY to be just the way it is now,
because not everybody likes the idea of all their sessions being
bound together in a single window; and finally I'd want to be
convinced that the code size increase wouldn't be excessive. This is
close to being a non-wish, in fact, unless someone can convince me
it's really worth its while.

<!-- might need to put this back if anyone ever reports it again and
isn't satisfied with RDB's solution as of build 2001-01-30
<li>
I'm still getting the occasional report of Telnet SYNCH not working
quite right (common symptoms being "&ograve;" and/or "&yuml;"
appearing when you press Ctrl-C at a Unix shell prompt). If somebody
who <em>really</em> knows about OOB data (aka TCP Urgent) could look
over my Windows networking code and fix the OOB handling so that it
actually works, that would be fantastic. After much swearing, I'm
not convinced this is actually possible, but I'm not confident of my
diagnosis either. I'd like somebody who really does know their stuff
to either fix it for me, or convince me it seriously is impossible.
-->

</ul>

<h2>Non-wish list</h2>

<p>
These are features I am actively opposed to seeing in PuTTY. Don't
bother writing them and sending them to me! If you think you have a
good argument why they would be good, feel free to plead for them,
but generally I'll already have a good reason not to do them.

<ul>

<li>
Use of the System tray. So many people have requested this that I
think it's a genuine desirable feature, but I don't want it to bloat
the core of PuTTY. Therefore, it should be implemented using a
separate program. There are a variety of programs out there already
that do this. Here are some links to them.
  <ul>
  <li>

<li>
The ability to specify the precise position on the screen you want
your PuTTY window to open at. This is clearly a very useful thing to
have, but it would be just as useful for all the <em>other</em>
Windows apps anyone uses. It shouldn't be the responsibility of
every single program to include a configuration option to specify
window position. Instead, it should be the responsibility of the
Windows system itself, or a third-party program, to remember where
you like individual programs to go.
<br>
One such program is

(shareware); another is

(free as in beer). If anyone knows of a free (as in speech) one, I'd
like to hear about it.

<li>
An option to automatically accept all SSH host keys. For some reason
lots of people seem to think this would be a really useful feature.
I'm sure it would be very convenient, but at the expense of
security! The whole point of host keys is that they're the
<em>only</em> guarantee you have that your connection hasn't been
hijacked by an active attacker between you and the server, and that
your data isn't being decrypted by the attacker and re-encrypted. If
you want to schedule an automated batch job to use PSCP or Plink,
and the interactive host key prompt is making this difficult,
<em>add the correct host key to the registry ahead of time</em>.
That way you still get the convenience, but without losing the
security. We will <em>not</em> accept a command line option to turn
off host key checking, no matter how many people have already done
the work and send us polished production-quality patches.

<li>
A transparent, semi-transparent or alpha-blended PuTTY window. We
think this is pointless frippery and would bloat the binary to no
useful purpose. Furthermore, there are third-party utilities which
will do this for you without us needing to modify PuTTY; have a look
at
