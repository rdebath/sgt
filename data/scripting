Summary: Scripting support in PuTTY
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low
Depends: mdpi
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p> Many people would find it useful for PuTTY to have a general
scripting mechanism. There are a lot of uses for something like
this:

<ul>
<li>
Automating movement through menu systems on servers.
<li>
Assigning common commands to function keys.
<li>
For MUD users: being able to set up triggers so that PuTTY
automatically sends commands when particular events happen on the
server.
<li>
Chaining connections. For example, the recommended way to connect to
<a href="www.mono.org">Monochrome BBS</a>
is to make a preliminary Telnet connection to a central server which
will tell you which of the usable machines has the lowest load, and
then to make a Telnet or SSH connection to that machine. A scripting
facility would allow PuTTY to do things like this automatically.
<li>
Remembering your password for you. (Obviously we don't recommend you
do this, on security grounds; but in one or two situations it might
be helpful.)
</ul>

<p>
We do have a scripting language half-way written for this purpose,
though it's unclear when (if) it will ever be finished.

<p>
A scripting language is liable to be a fairly big piece of code, so
the language interpreter might end up having to be implemented as a
DLL plugin. Hence this feature is dependent on us creating a DLL
plugin interface first.
