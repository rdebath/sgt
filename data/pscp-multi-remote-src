Summary: Perhaps PSCP should permit multiple remote sources
Class: wish

<p>
PSCP currently has no local way of specifying multiple remote files
explicitly (rather than with wildcards). (If it's using the SCP
backend, you may be able to use remote,
<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter5.html#pscp-usage-basics">unsafe</a>,
wildcards or shell constructs.)

<p>
i.e. you can't do
<br><pre>pscp server:file1 server:file2 server:another_file localdir</pre>

<p>
In order for this syntax to be more useful than multiple separate
invocations of PSCP, we'd have to be slightly clever to group requests
to the same server and avoid multiple sessions/re-authentications.

<p>
(Or perhaps we could add brace expansion to the set of local
"wildcards" we support, for the SFTP backend at least.)
