<p> When you adjust the properties of a running session using the
"Change Settings" menu option, it might be nice to be able to save
the adjusted settings back to the saved-session slot you loaded
from, or to a new session slot.

<p> This feature is one of our most requested, but is currently
pending some design work:

<ul>
<li>
If you load an existing saved session exactly "as is", by
double-clicking or by running "<code>putty @sessionname</code>" or
whatever, it's reasonably obvious that hitting the Save button in
mid-session should write the changed details back to the same slot
you loaded from.
<li>
What if you loaded the session, modified a setting or two, and
<em>then</em> started it? Should a mid-session Save still write back
to the original slot by default? It sounds as if it obviously
should ... but what if the one setting you changed was the
<em>hostname</em>? Suddenly I think it's no longer completely
obvious that you should be conveniently able to overwrite your
previous saved session with the new one.
<li>
So the user interface for this feature needs some serious thought;
we have to have a means for working out precisely when it does and
does not make sense to have an automatic
save-to-where-we-loaded-from button available.
</ul>
