<p>
Despite sharing large parts of the Windows API, WinCE doesn't appear
to be significantly easier to port to than a totally different
operating system.  A port is in the pipeline, although it's only in
its early stages yet.

<p>
There's a third-party port called PocketPuTTY on our
<a href="../links.html">Links page</a>. At the
time of writing, I don't think any of us have tried it. It's possible
that it could be merged into the main tree at some point, but there'd
need to be some upheaval, primarily to cope with everything being
wide strings and the like on WinCE.
