Summary: Remove fixed-length buffers in configuration structure
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: medium
Depends: config-locations
Content-type: text/x-html-body
Fixed-in: r9214

<p>
Currently PuTTY uses a single <code>struct</code>
(<code>Config</code>) containing a bunch of fixed-length buffers to
store its configuration. This leads to problems such as
<a href="portfwd-space.html">limited space for port forwardings</a>.
It should clearly be replaced with a structure containing references
to allocated storage.

<p>
This isn't entirely trivial, which is probably the main reason we
haven't done it yet:

<ul>

<li><em>Object housekeeping.</em> Currently, when a
<code>Config</code> needs to be duplicated intra-process, a structure
copy is usually by and large adequate, with occasional grotty
fixing-up of pointers. Similar issues apply to construction and
destruction. We'd need to replace this with proper suite of object
housekeeping functions.

<li><em>Serialisation.</em> Currently `Duplicate Session' is
implemented by squirting the <code>struct</code> over to another
process and crossing our fingers. This is obviously icky, and clearly
won't be sufficient when there are more pointers around.
<br>Any textual format we invent to
<a href="config-locations.html">store configuration in a file</a>
would probably be suitable for this too; so this should probably wait
until we've done that (which we already have to some extent for the
Unix port).

<li><em>Opaque objects.</em> Some platforms may use opaque objects to
represent things like filenames. These need to be copyable,
serialisable etc.

</ul>
