Summary: Fonts that overflow their character cells cause problems
Class: bug

<p>There's a two-pronged problem with fonts whose characters overlap
outside their designated rectangular cell.
<ul>
<li>
Firstly, we don't deal
well with this. Each <em>string</em> passed to
<code>do_text()</code> is clipped to the rectangle it should be in;
but <em>within</em> that string there's still scope for overlap
between character cells. If half the string is then updated then
there will be artefacts left on the screen.
<li>
Secondly, the resize-by-changing-font code has a tendency to choose
fonts that cause this problem a lot. For bitmap fonts I think this
is just a hazard of the job - if you ask PuTTY to resize a non-
resizeable font, you can expect it to do a shoddy job at best - but
it even happens slightly in Courier New (the very RH edge of the
lower case m sometimes protrudes into the next character cell),
which really isn't on. Sadly I have no idea how we can fix this in
general - if we ask for a smaller width than we really want, then
(a) we penalise well-behaved fonts, and (b) the spacing when drawing
a large string will come out wrong.
</ul>
<p>
Simon has a cunning idea for dealing with this.  The plan is
that whenever we paint a string on the screen, we clip it to its bounding
rectangle (this should happen already), and then whenever we change the 
contents of the rectangle, we always re-paint the whole thing, splitting
it into smaller rectangles, or joining rectangles together as appropriate.
This way, we never leave droppings behind, because whenever a character is
erased, the entire clipping box that was in force when it was painted is
cleared as well.
