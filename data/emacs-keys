Summary: Emacs cursor-key etc mappings

<p>Quite a few applications which don't understand VT100 cursor-key sequences
do understand Emacs-style ones.  It might thus be a good idea to have an
option to emit them.  Sensible ones include:

<table>
 <tr><td>Up    <td>^P
 <tr><td>Down  <td>^N
 <tr><td>Left  <td>^B
 <tr><td>Right <td>^F
 <tr><td>Home  <td>^A
 <tr><td>End   <td>^E
 <tr><td>Delete<td>^D
</table>
