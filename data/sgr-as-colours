Summary: Be able to change text colour or font in response to SGR Bold, Underline etc
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: fun
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Allow the user to select a different default colour for underlined
text, and a different default background colour for bold text, and
so on. Not everybody wants true WYSIWYG in attribute rendering.
Also, consider the possibility of changing <em>fonts</em> for some
of these criteria (might be useful for people with low vision).
