Summary: Beep using the PC speaker

Among the many bell options we already support, it would be nice to
support the built-in PC speaker. Unfortunately this seems to be
non-trivial: on Win95-series systems this can apparently be done
using MessageBeep(0xFFFFFFFF), but on NT-series systems this doesn't
do anything different from MessageBeep(MB_OK).  Meanwhile on NT,
Beep(Freq, Duration) uses the PC speaker, but that plays the default
sound on Win95. So we'd need to auto-detect which kind
of system we were running on.
