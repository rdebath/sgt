Summary: Support for SSH2: zero, or more than one, terminal per session

<p>
SSH 2 is a much more flexible protocol than SSH 1. It doesn't
require exactly one terminal session per SSH connection; you can
have more than one, or indeed none at all.

<p>
It would be nice if PuTTY could make use of this. For example, there
could be a System menu option to start an extra terminal window
inside the same SSH connection as the existing one(s). This would be
more efficient than the existing Duplicate Session command, and also
wouldn't require repeated authentication (which you don't care that
much about if you're using public keys, but you might care a lot if
you don't want to have to type your password in again).

<p>
Going in the other direction, several people have asked if it could
be possible to start PuTTY <em>without</em> starting a terminal
window and a shell - just have PuTTY sit in the background and do
port forwarding only. This would also be possible in theory.

<p>
Similarly, perhaps we should also support running (e.g.) psftp
sessions over an existing connection rather than forcing a new TCP/SSH
connection, using the same sort of inter-process communication as with
Pageant. Needs careful implementation to avoid opening security holes.
