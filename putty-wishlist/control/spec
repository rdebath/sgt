Bug files have the basic format of RFC-822 mail messages, but without any
of the semantics of particular headers specified by the RFC.  Instead,
the following headers are defined:

Summary:
  Contains a brief description of the bug, preferably < 1 line long.
  Written in plain text.

Class:
  One of:
    bug		This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.
    semi-bug	This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise
		definition of what a bug is.
    wish	This is a request for an enhancement.

Priority:
  One of:
    high	This should be fixed in the next release.
    medium	This should be fixed one day.
    low		We aren't sure whether to fix this or not.
    never	We don't ever intend to fix this.

Difficulty:
  One of:
    fun		Just needs tuits, and not many of them.
    tricky	Needs many tuits.
    taxing	Needs external things we don't have (standards, users etc)
    mayhem	Probably impossible

Present-in:
  Versions of PuTTY that this bug has been observed in.  Space-separated
  list of entries like:
    0.52	Indicates a release that contained the bug
    2002-04-30	Indicates a snapshot that contained the bug

Absent-in:
  Versions of PuTTY that don't exhibit this bug, (e.g. because they predate
  its introcuction).  Same format as Present-in.

Fixed-in:
  Versions of PuTTY after which the bug should be fixed.  Same format as
  Present-in.

Depends:
  Bugs that will need to be fixed (or features that will need to be
  implemented) before this one.  Space-separated list of filenames.

Content-type:
  The MIME content-type of the body of the message.  text/plain and
  text/x-html-body are supported.

The body of the message contains a fragment of HTML that explains the bug
