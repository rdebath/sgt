Summary: Managing multiple connections in one PuTTY

<p>
A lot of people seem to want a single PuTTY to be able to manage
multiple connections. Some want an MDI-style application, with one
large main window containing several session windows; other people
want the window to stay the same size and the multiple sessions to
be selected by Alt-F1, Alt-F2 etc., or by selecting tabs on the
window.

<p>
For a start, this can't be done until we've ceased using static
variables in the PuTTY back end code. But even assuming that, it
would involve a fair amount of reorganisation to set up. In addition
I'd want a strong guarantee of reliability (if one session crashes,
can it avoid taking the other nine down?). Also I'd want to be able
to configure PuTTY to be just the way it is now, because not
everybody likes the idea of all their sessions being bound together
in a single window; and finally I'd want to be convinced that the
code size increase wouldn't be excessive. This is close to having
priority "never", in fact, unless someone can convince me it's
really worth its while.
