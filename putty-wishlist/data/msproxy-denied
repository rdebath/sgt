I believe I have found a bug in Win32 putty .53b. (found in Win2000,
also tested current dev binary).  I am connection to a NetBSD server 1.6
running OpenSSH 3.4 on port 443, but had the same problem on an OpenBSD
server with OpenSSH 3.4.

I am connecting through an authenticated Microsoft Proxy server v2 on
Windows 2000, using HTTP proxy services.


Using Putty, the connection conversation is: 

 CONNECT 216.138.219.54:443 HTTP/1.1
 Host: 216.138.219.54:443
 Proxy-Authorization: basic YW1leeljYXNcc3RldmVfYmFya2V5OmluZXNzMTA=

 HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Access Denied
 Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
 Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2002 19:32:43 GMT
 Connection: close
 Proxy-Authenticate: Negotiate
 Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM
 Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="53.244.73.245"

And the connection fails with putty event log: 
"2002-12-31 14:48:08    Connecting to 216.138.219.54 port 443
2002-12-31 14:48:08     Proxy error: 407 Proxy Access Denied"


Using MindTerm 2.0 (an inferior java ssh client), the connection
conversation is:

 CONNECT 216.138.219.54:443 HTTP/1.0
 proxy-connection: Keep-Alive
 pragma: No-Cache
 user-agent: MindTerm/$Name:  $

 HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Access Denied

 Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2002 19:33:05 GMT
 Proxy-Authenticate: Negotiate
 Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM
 Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="53.244.73.245"

----------- and then -----------

 CONNECT 216.138.219.54:443 HTTP/1.0
 proxy-authorization: Basic YW1leeljYXNcc3RldmVfYmFya2V5OmluZXNzMTA=

 proxy-connection: Keep-Alive
