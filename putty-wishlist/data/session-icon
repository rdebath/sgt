<p>
Yet another means of distinguishing multiple PuTTY sessions: replacing
the normal PuTTY window/taskbar icon with a different one, on a
per-session basis.

<p>
Technically, the hardest bit of this I see is implementing an icon
chooser. As far as I know there's no convenient icon chooser in Common
Controls or Common Dialogs that we could use. Implementing one
ourselves seems like a lot of work and would also bloat PuTTY.

<p>
An alternative would be to only allow a file to be picked, and take
the first icon in the file, but that's a bit naff.

<ul>
<li><em>Update:</em> There is an undocumented interface to get at
Windows' icon chooser from <code>SHELL32.DLL</code>, called
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/shell/selecticon.asp"><code>PickIconDlg</code></a>;
there's some faff involved but it does appear to be
<a href="http://www.partware.com/ebooks/api/ref/p/pickicondlg.html">available
across a wide range of Windows versions</a>. (Not sure about Win32s.)
</ul>

<p>
Also, we already have various means of distinguishing sessions, and we
keep getting asked for more. If we added them all, PuTTY would
balloon.
