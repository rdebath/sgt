Summary: Support for GSSAPI (for Kerberos, GSI, etc)

<p>
We occasionally get requests for Kerberos and/or GSSAPI support.

<p>
This looks complicated and messy.

<p>
Any proposed solution should take into account our
<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixD.html">design guidelines</a>
to be even considered for inclusion. In particular, some submissions
have not taken into account PuTTY's cross-platform nature.

<p>
In SSH-2, Kerberos is supported through
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/kerberos-faq/general/section-84.html">
GSSAPI</a>;
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4462.txt">RFC 4462</a>
(formerly <tt><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/secsh/draft-ietf-secsh-gsskeyex/">draft-ietf-secsh-gsskeyex</a></tt>)
describes GSSAPI key exchange and user authentication in SSH-2.
(Some of the patches here appear to be based
on earlier versions of this specification, for instance the userauth
method "gssapi".)

<p>
It appears that Globus <a href="http://www.globus.org/security/overview.html">
GSI</a> authentication also uses GSSAPI, though for some reason needs
a different client implementation (and yet a third if you want to support
both).

<p>Patches we've seen (links are on our <a href="../links.html">Links page</a>):

<ul>

<li>Certified Security Solutions have a patched
version of PuTTY which supports Kerberos 5 in SSH-1 and GSSAPI key
exchange and user authentication in SSH-2. For GSSAPI, Win9x/NT
require the 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dist/index.html">MIT Kerberos library</a>;
Win2K/XP can use Microsoft SSPI.

<li>
Another patch (unreviewed): <tt>1067597353.3fa23e29bf70c@webmail.technion.ac.il</tt>
<br>User authentication; <tt>secur32.lib</tt> (Windows) /
<tt>krb5-config</tt> (Unix)

<li>
Another patch from sweb.cz adds support
for GSSAPI user authentication using the MIT Kerberos library. (A
previous version of this patch has been reviewed and found wanting.)

<li>
Yet another patch: Quest PuTTY (formerly Vintela PuTTY)
<br>3-term BSD licence; GSSAPI (Kerberos-specific?) user
authentication using MS SSPI; not thoroughly reviewed but doesn't look
hopeful

</ul>

<p>
Binary-only versions:

<ul>

<li>
Centrify provide a
<a href="http://www.centrify.com/resources/putty.asp">modified version of PuTTY</a>
which uses the Windows SSPI for GSSAPI support. It includes features
specific to their other products.

</ul>

<hr>

<em>Update:</em> some forms of Kerberos support are now implemented:

<ul>
<li>As of 2008-08-10, r8138: support for Kerberos user authentication in
  SSH-2 using a single library (SSPI in Windows, build-time choice on Unix);
<li>As of 2010-05-20, r8952: support for multiple libraries with choice
  at run time; Windows builds now support
  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/">MIT Kerberos</a> in addition to SSPI.
</ul>
  
Things not done:

<ul>
<li>GSSAPI key exchange;
<li>Any authentication protocol other than Kerberos;
<li>SSH-1 support (we are very unlikely to do anything about this; SSH-1
is obsolete).
</ul>
