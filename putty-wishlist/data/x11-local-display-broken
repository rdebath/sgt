Summary: X11 forwarding to implicitly specified local display broken
Class: bug

Priority: high

<p>
In PuTTY and Plink 0.56, X11 forwarding would not work if the local X
display location was not specified in the configuration dialog or a
saved session, and the location inferred from the environment was of
the form <tt>:0.0</tt> (i.e., no hostname or transport type specified
before the colon), or if no local display is specified anywhere (in
which case a hard-coded default of <tt>:0</tt> will be used).

<p>
This is more likely to affect users of the Unix version running PuTTY
on their local machines, who will expect the display location to be
taken from the environment; under Windows, users are more likely to
specify the X display location explicitly, and also old versions of
PuTTY defaulted to <tt>localhost:0</tt>, which could persist in saved
sessions / Default Settings. Windows users could however be affected
if they leave the display location blank in the configuration and rely
on PuTTY's default of <tt>localhost:0</tt>.

<p>
This is fixed as of 2004-11-19. Workarounds for 0.56 include:
<ul>
<li>Specify an argument like <tt>--display unix:0</tt> (Unix PuTTY
only)
<li>Change the environment variable <tt>DISPLAY</tt> in PuTTY/Plink's
environment to the form <tt>unix:0</tt> (or <tt>localhost:0</tt> on
Windows) 
<li>Specify the display location explicitly in PuTTY's configuration
dialog
</ul>
