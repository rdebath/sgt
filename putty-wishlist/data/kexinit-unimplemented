Curious:  If I use PuTTY to connect to wraith.csi.cam.ac.uk, and request key
re-exchange before typing the user name, the packet log shows PuTTY getting an
SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED, but PuTTY doesn't bombout(("expected key exchange
packet from server")) as I'd expect.  Of course, it also doesn't give up on the
key exchange, which it perhaps should.

Well, UNIMPLEMENTED won't be going to do_ssh2_transport(), because it's not in
the transport layer range of message numbers [20,50). So I suppose it'd go to
do_ssh2_authconn().

My guess is that it's being swallowed in the crWaitUntilV(!pktin) at line 6076,
which I suppose ought to be fixed somehow.

Responding to the UNIMPLEMENTED by abandoning that particular key exchange
sounds above the call of duty to me, I have to say, when the fault is obviously
OpenSSH's.

Ah.  That would explain my confusion.

I suppose so.  It's not as if we're likely to do an automatic re-exchange
before authentication is complete, so exiting with an error at that stage would
be reasonable.  I'll add a wishlist item, since that code scares me.
