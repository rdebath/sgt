Summary: Embedded RomSShell server closes connection with "Bad string Length"
Absent-in: 0.60
Present-in: 0.61
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
We've had several reports from people connecting to embedded devices
of the server abruptly terminating the connection:

<p>
<code>Server sent disconnect message type 2 (protocol error): "Bad string Length".</code>

<p>
In the cases we've investigated, the server has turned out to be
an implementation of Allegro's "RomSShell", and the server is clearly
buggy.

<p>
As part of the fix for <a href="flow-control.html">flow-control</a>
in 0.61, PuTTY sometimes sends
<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixF.html#sshnames-channel">a special request type</a>
to the SSH server with the name "winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org",
to calibrate large data transfers.

<p>
The RomSShell server objects to this request on the grounds (as far as
we can tell) that its name is 34 characters long; experiments by one
of our correspondents indicate that RomSShell accepts a maximum of 31
characters. The <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4251.txt">SSH-2 standard</a>
clearly states a maximum length on request names, and it's 64
characters, not 31 or 32. So RomSShell is being unreasonable in
rejecting a 34-character name.

<p>
From PuTTY 0.63 onwards, this can be worked around with the
<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ssh-bug-winadj">"Chokes on PuTTY's SSH-2 'winadj' requests"</a>
bug-compatibility mode. However, it's not currently automatically
detected.

<p>
If anyone who runs into this has some channel to contact Allegro
(a support contract or other clout), it would be helpful to point this
out to them (we have no means of getting in contact). If the bug is
fixed at source and the complete set of affected SSH version strings
provided to us, we can automatically enable the workaround in PuTTY
when appropriate (although from the patterns below, this doesn't look
likely to be sensible).

<p>
Reported with the following servers / devices:
<ul>
<li><tt>SSH-2.0-RomSShell_4.64</tt> (reported by Allegro customer?)</li>
<li><tt>SSH-2.0-RomSShell_4.62</tt> in "iLO 3 Standard Blade Edition 1.26"
in a "HP Proliant BL460c G7"</li>
<li><tt>SSH-2.0-RomSShell_4.61.</tt> in a "Brocade MLXe"
<ul>
<li>Brocade themselves actually assigned a bug number to this
(DEFECT000362023, "SSH server in-compatible with Putty 0.61"), and
said "this bug is fixed in 5.1.0E or later software code." (Don't know
whether they got Allegro to fix it, or fixed it themselves. Sadly
the version string is reportedly unchanged.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adtran 3120 (reportedly, "ADTRAN OS version 16.03.00.SC.E" shows the
problem but "17.07.02.00.E" does not -- both <tt>SSH-2.0-RomSShell_4.31</tt>,
unhelpfully)</li>
</ul>
