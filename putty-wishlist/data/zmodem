Summary: File transfers using Zmodem
Class: wish

<p>
Lots of people seem to want Zmodem file transfers. We don't see that
this is a vital requirement because we already supply two file
transfer mechanisms in the PuTTY suite; but if someone were to do
the work for us we might accept it.

Then again, it might be better if it went in as a DLL plugin.
Depends how big it is, I think.
