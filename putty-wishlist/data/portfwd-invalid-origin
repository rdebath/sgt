<p>
In SSH-2, the local-to-remote port-forwarding request is defined by
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/secsh/draft-ietf-secsh-connect/">secsh-connect</a>
to contain an "originator IP address" and "originator port", which
identify to the server where the connection the client received came
from.

<p>
PuTTY has always taken the view that this is none of the server's
business, and sent the bogus IP address <tt>client-side-connection</tt>
and port 0.

<p>
Apparently, some servers take exception to this (with some
justification) and refuse the forwarding. Specifically, a problem
has reported with
<a href="http://www.ssh.com/products/tectia/server/">SSH Tectia Server (T)</a>
for Windows, version 5.0.0-844, and also with F-Secure SSH for Unix,
version 3.1.0. Using <tt>0.0.0.0</tt> instead appears
to mollify these servers.
