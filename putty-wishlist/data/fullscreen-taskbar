Summary: Switching to full-screen doesn't always hide taskbar
Class: bug
Present-in: 0.53b 2003-10-23

When switching to full-screen mode (e.g. with Alt-Enter), the taskbar
is not always hidden. In some proportion of switches it stays on top.

(At least, for a while. With 0.53b and Win98, it does disappear
within a second or two if not immediately. I couldn't say for sure
that wasn't the behaviour years ago.)

I (JTN) have only noticed it on Win98 systems (2 so far), but it has
been the case on that platform for ages.
