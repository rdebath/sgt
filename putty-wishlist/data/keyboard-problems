<p>Problems with various keyboard layouts. It would be hard for me to
debug these myself because I'd have to be able to work in the same
keymap as I was testing PuTTY in! If anybody can debug these
problems it would be greatly appreciated.
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="http://www.users.one.se/liket/svorak/">svorak</a> (Swedish
Dvorak) layout apparently gets a few control combinations wrong: ^W,
^V and ^Z.
<li>
On the Danish keyboard, apparently the tilde (~) is acting as a dead
key <em>and</em> generating a code in itself; so if you hit ~ and
then n, you get a ~ followed by a &ntilde;.
<li>
There's been a report from a Korean user that Korean multi-byte
input doesn't work.
<li>
A German user has reported that Caps Lock is more like Shift Lock -
it affects a lot of keys other than alphabetics.
</ul>
