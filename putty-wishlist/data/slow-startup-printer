Summary: Printer enumeration may cause slow startup

<p>
There's been a suggestion (ref:
<tt>000c01c282b0$c6ae6c90$6e01a8c0@int.psross.net</tt>) that the ANSI
printer support added in 0.53 can cause PuTTY to take a long time to
start (~30 seconds) if a printer is configured in Windows that is not
reachable (e.g. shared from a machine that is currently switched off).
This may be intermittent rather than reliable. (Win2K Pro SP3)

<p>
PuTTY calls Windows functions to enumerate all suitable printers
(regardless of whether any attempt is made to <em>use</em> the ANSI
printing functionality):
<ul>
<li>when a saved session is loaded into the configuration dialog;
<li>when a new panel is selected via the treeview control;
<li>when the config dialog is initially drawn (side effect of above).
</ul>
This means that this is <em>not</em> done if the configuration dialog
is bypassed (e.g., by loading a saved session directly).

<p>
PuTTY is a bit unusual in doing this; we use EnumPrinters (etc)
directly in order to avoid UI issues associated with the concept of
`raw' printing.

<p>
I've not been able to reproduce this on Win2K Pro.

<p>
This is to some extent not our problem, but perhaps we could do
something to mitigate the problem (e.g. enumerate printers less often
/ only if the user requests the ANSI printing functionality).
