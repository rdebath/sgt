Summary: SSH-2 rekey bug-compatibility setting not saved
Class: bug
Difficulty: fun
Present-in: 0.58
Fixed-in: r6473 2005-12-02

<p>
In 0.58, a new SSH bug-compatibility mode was added to PuTTY:
<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ssh-bug-rekey">"Handles SSH-2 key re-exchange badly"</a>.

<p>
However, in 0.58, attempts to save any setting other than "Auto" fail
- the setting stays at "Auto". (Apparently there is some NetApp server
- "Data ONTAP" - that needs this mode and can't be distinguished by
our heuristics.) This is fixed in the development snapshots.

<p>
If the setting is present in the saved settings, 0.58 will happily
load it, so a workaround for 0.58 users is to use a snapshot just to
save the setting to the desired value, and then revert to using 0.58.
(Alternatively, you could edit the setting manually; its name is
<tt>BugRekey2</tt> with values 0=Auto, 1=Off, 2=On.)
