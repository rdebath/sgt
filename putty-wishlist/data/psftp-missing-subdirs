Summary: PSFTP "mput -r *" misses some items in subdirectories
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Content-type: text/plain

As reported to us:

I think I have found a problem with mput -r * in PSFTP version 0.59.
I'm running XP (32bit) with all service packs loaded.
I'm experiencing a problem when I use mput -r * to upload my files to
sourceforge.net.
It uploads the files in the current directory, but in the subdirectories it
only uploads the last file.

example
If my directory looks like this:
index.html
install.html
usage.html
en <- subdirectory
  index.html
  install.html
  usage.html
  images <- sub-subdirectory
    a.jpg
    b.jpg
de <- another subdirectory
  index.html
  install.html
  usage.html
  images <- sub-subdirectory
    a.jpg
    b.jpg

the following files get transferred only
index.html
usage.html
install.html
en/usage.html
de/usage.html

the sub-subdirectories are not processed at all.
