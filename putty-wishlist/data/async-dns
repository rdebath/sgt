Summary: DNS lookups are synchronous.

<p>DNS lookups are synchronous. We could make them async quite easily,
which would stop the last potential delay before the PuTTY window
appears and would also prevent an absent DNS server from hanging
PuTTY while a remote-to-local port forwarding times out on DNS; but
ideally I'd like an abstraction of DNS so that we can still port
later (since the socket API only has synchronous DNS). Porting to
Unix will be fine (we can use adns), and any thread-capable OS won't
have a problem. Everything else will just have to degrade gracefully
to synchronous DNS, which will be fun. :-(
