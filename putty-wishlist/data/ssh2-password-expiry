Summary: Support for SSH-2 password expiry mechanisms
Class: semi-bug
Priority: low
Difficulty: fun
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
PuTTY doesn't currently support the password expiry mechanisms
represented in <code>draft-ietf-secsh-userauth-16</code> by
<code>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PASSWD_CHANGEREQ</code> et al.

<p>
But then again, no-one's complained. Most servers seem to use
keyboard-interactive to implement this, so maybe it would just
be code bloat serving no useful purpose.

<p>
Old versions of the 
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~dtucker/openssh/">OpenSSH password
expiry patches</a> used to use this mechanism, but I believe that
newer versions (including the version that was incorporated in OpenSSH
3.8) don't.
