Summary: Compatibility mappings for Unicode characters unsupported by a font

<p>
It's well known that Red Hat 8 boxes start up in UTF-8 by default,
and hence that PuTTY must be set into UTF-8 mode or else commands
such as man(1) will Do The Wrong Thing.

<p>
I (SGT) have just had a chance to actually play with PuTTY
connecting to a RH8 box, and discovered that even with UTF-8
enabled, you don't always get the right results. man(1) handles
hyphen/minus characters inconsistently: in some situations it
produces U+2212 MINUS SIGN, but in others it produces U+2010 HYPHEN.
("man rm" is a good way to show up both types.) Many Windows fonts
(Lucida Console, Courier New) support the former but not the latter,
so that even in UTF-8 mode there are nasty "unknown character"
rectangles appearing in the man page.

<p>
I think a neat solution to this would be to have a list of
compatibility character translations, mapping a single Unicode code
point to a different single Unicode code point, so that U+2010 could
be displayed as U+2212 (or even U+002D!). This feature would also be
useful for displaying U+0060 and U+0027 as U+2018 and U+2019, to
ease the conflict between TeX-era Unix users who quote `like this'
and pedantic fonts in which those quotes utterly fail to match).

<p>
Points to consider:
<ul>
<li>
In its raw form this feature could be more pain than it was worth:
anyone switching between fonts would have to add or remove
compatibility mappings to reflect the available characters in the
new font. I believe it should be possible (Character Map can
certainly do it) for PuTTY to query the font at run time and
determine which characters are unsupported, and to enable only those
mappings necessary. That way, we can ship with a large number of
default mappings which should Just Work for almost all fonts.
<li>
Of course, this will stop the feature being useful for the TeX
quotes problem! To preserve this aspect, we would have to be able to
configure each individual mapping to be unconditional (applied no
matter what), or conditional (applied only if the current font does
not contain the source character).
<li>
It seems clear to me that these mappings should be applied at the
display level, not the terminal input level: the terminal data
structures should store the original untransformed characters, so
that cut and paste doesn't depend on the selected font. (But, aargh,
what about RTF pasting which <em>specifies</em> the font?! Perhaps
I'll choose to ignore that for the moment...)
</ul>
