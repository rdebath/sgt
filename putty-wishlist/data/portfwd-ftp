Summary: Support for tunnelling FTP

Priority: low
Difficulty: tricky

<p>
FTP is inherently difficult to tunnel over SSH, because it uses
multiple network connections, so the `obvious' approach of just
forwarding port 21 doesn't work.

<p>
To support this, PuTTY would need to grovel inside inside the
application-layer protocol and rewrite PORT commands and such, or
alternatively, provide an FTP proxy.

<p>
Either of these would be quite a large and fiddly feature, and given
that we already support alternative secure file-transfer solutions
(scp, sftp), we're unlikely to implement this ourselves. In fact, in
order not to bloat the core of PuTTY, we probably wouldn't contemplate
it at all unless it could be implemented as a separate DLL.
