This archive contains WinURL, a small System Tray application to
launch URLs which have been copied to the clipboard.

Running WinURL should be pretty much self-explanatory. Just run the
binary, and the WinURL icon should appear in the System tray. Now if
you copy a URL to the clipboard and left-click on the WinURL System
tray icon, your default web browser should launch that URL. Pressing
Windows+W has the same effect. Right-clicking on the System tray
icon, will produce a small menu which allows you to exit WinURL.

WinURL is distributed under the MIT licence, which is provided in the
file LICENCE.
