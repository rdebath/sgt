/*
 * xtruss: looks like strace, quacks like xmon.
 *
 * xtruss monitors the data sent and received between an X client
 * and the X server, and logs it in a format reminiscent of Linux's
 * strace(1). Its command-line syntax is also similar to strace: in
 * the simplest invocation, you just run the target X program
 * exactly as you normally would but prefix it with 'xtruss', e.g.
 * 'xtruss xterm -fn 9x15'. If your X server supports the X RECORD
 * extension, you can also attach xtruss to a client which is
 * already running, by specifying an X resource id (similarly to
 * xkill(1)) or by selecting a window interactively with the mouse.
 *
 * I wrote it because xmon irritated me by not being enough like
 * strace: a pain to set up (two confusingly cooperating processes,
 * no automatic handling of authorisation for the proxy display) and
 * unreadable in its output (half a screen per request or response,
 * and no way to see at a glance what request a response was a reply
 * to).
 *
 * This is a spinoff project from the PuTTY code base: the X proxy
 * code reuses the X forwarding framework from PuTTY, because that
 * provided for free all the code that invents new authorisation
 * data and checks and replaces it in the proxied connections.
 */

/*
 * Possible future work:
 *
 *  - Arrange to let the network abstraction keep the peer address
 *    of incoming connections, so that we can provide
 *    XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 on the proxy side at user request.
 *
 *  - Decode more extensions.
 *
 *  - Log connection and disconnection of clients?
 *
 *  - Perhaps a command-line option to request tracing of only the
 *    first incoming connection and just proxy the rest untraced?
 *
 *  - Work out what to do about extension tracking in -p mode.
 *     * The only thing I can think of at the moment is for our
 * 	 control connection to do a ListExtensions and then lots of
 * 	 QueryExtension before we even attach to the target client.
 *     * But are we guaranteed that extension opcode indices will be
 * 	 the same between all client connections? It'd certainly be
 * 	 the _obvious_ way to implement an X server, but I don't
 * 	 think anything in the protocol specifically requires it.
 * 	 Another thing a server might choose to do would be to
 * 	 allocate extension number-space sequentially from the base
 * 	 but independently for each client connection, and translate
 * 	 the event numbers in SendEvents between clients. The
 * 	 advantage of doing this would be that the server could
 * 	 support more extensions than fit into the number space, and
 * 	 each client could use any subset of them that _would_ fit.
 *
 *  - Command-line-configurable display format: be able to omit
 *    parameter names for expert users?
 *
 *  - Command-line configurable display format: alternative methods
 *    of handling separated requests and responses? I definitely
 *    like the one I've got now, but there's scope for others to be
 *    selectable.
 *     * Such as, for instance, "Request(params) = <unfinished
 * 	 #xxxx>" followed by " ... <#xxxx> = {response}", which has
 * 	 the virtue that it doesn't repeat enormous request lines in
 * 	 the output.
 *     * More radically than that, perhaps, never combine request
 * 	 and response lines at all - just print a sequence number on
 * 	 absolutely everything, and leave untangling it to the
 * 	 reader.
 *
 *  - Prettyprinting of giant data structure returns, by inserting
 *    newlines and appropriate indentation?
 *
 *  - Tracking of server state to usefully annotate the connection.
 *     * We could certainly track currently known atoms, starting
 * 	 with the standard predefined set and adding them when we
 * 	 see the replies to InternAtom and GetAtomName.
 * 	  + Another more radical approach here would be to establish
 * 	    our own connection to the server and use it to _look up_
 * 	    any atom id we don't already know before we print the
 * 	    request/response in which it appears.
 * 	  + In order to be able to do those lookups synchronously
 * 	    within do_request and friends, this would require some
 * 	    tinkering with the event loop code, or alternatively
 * 	    handling our own X connection entirely outside the main
 * 	    event loop. The alternative is to turn do_request &c
 * 	    into coroutines of some sort, but I think all the
 * 	    queuing gets too hideous if we try that.
 *     * We could try tracking currently valid window and pixmap ids
 * 	 so that we can disambiguate the letter prefix on a
 * 	 DRAWABLE, and likewise track fonts and graphics contexts so
 * 	 we can disambiguate FONTABLE.
 * 	  + Bit fiddly, this one, due to synchronisation issues
 * 	    between c2s and s2c. A request which changes the current
 * 	    state should immediately affect annotation of subsequent
 * 	    requests, but its effect on annotation of responses
 * 	    would have to be deferred until the sequence numbers in
 * 	    the response stream caught up with that request. Ick.
 * 	  + Not to mention the fact that tracking active window ids
 * 	    is _hard_: child windows are destroyed with their
 * 	    parent, so you'd have to track window hierarchy too, and
 * 	    worse still windows can be unilaterally reparented by
 * 	    other clients so even that isn't reliable. Even Xlib
 * 	    doesn't try to track active resource ids on the client
 * 	    side, hence the XC-MISC extension to get back a chunk of
 * 	    its id space when trivial sequential allocation runs
 * 	    out.
 * 	  + So perhaps in fact this is just a silly and
 * 	    overambitious idea and I'd be wiser not to try.
 *
 *  - Other strace-like output options, such as prefixed timestamps
 *    (-t, -tt, -ttt), alignment (-a), and more filtering options
 *    under -e (e.g. filter on particular resource ids? Though that
 *    doesn't sound _obviously_ useful...).
 *
 *  - More xprop/xkill-like command line syntax for choosing a
 *    client to trace via X RECORD? -id 0xXXX as a synonym for -p
 *    XXX, for instance. Perhaps -name (for which we can reuse the
 *    existing bfs loop to look for a window with the given WM_NAME
 *    property). And should just 'xtruss' with no arguments work
 *    like just 'xprop'?
 *
 *  - Find some way of independently testing the correctness of the
 *    vast amount of this program that I translated straight out of
 *    the X protocol specs...
 *
 *  - Ability to run as an explicit proxy, as other X tracing
 *    utilities do. Run in this mode, xtruss should print the
 *    appropriate DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment variables to
 *    standard output in a form easily pasted into another shell
 *    prompt, and then sit there waiting for connections.
 *
 *  - Clean the source code up:
 *     + Separate the potentially cross-platform X protocol decoder
 * 	 from the Unix-specific front end implementation
 *     + Split up the giant switch-statement functions into smaller
 * 	 pieces: compilers already struggle a bit with them on high
 * 	 optimisation levels, and they'll only get bigger if more X
 * 	 extensions become supported
 *     + Think about how to manage the source modules cribbed from
 * 	 PuTTY: want to strike a good balance between keeping them
 * 	 PuTTYlike enough to be able to feed useful changes back,
 * 	 and keeping them small and xtruss-specific enough for the
 * 	 tarball not to look utterly stupid or include unnecessary
 * 	 gunk.
