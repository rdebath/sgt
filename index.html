<p>
PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 and Unix
platforms, along with an <code>xterm</code> terminal emulator. It is
written and maintained primarily by
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~anakin/">Simon Tatham</a>.

<p>
The latest version is beta 0.56.

<p><b>LEGAL WARNING</b>:
Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where
encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP,
PSFTP and Plink in England and many other countries, but I am not a
lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before
downloading it. You may find
<a href="http://rechten.uvt.nl/koops/cryptolaw/">this site</a>
useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I
can't vouch for its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any
cryptography laws.

<b>2004-11-16 Migration to Subversion</b>

<p>As of today, the PuTTY source tree has migrated away from CVS, to
use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> as its
version control system. I'm afraid this means that anyone who was
previously checking our source out of CVS will have to start
checking it out using Subversion instead.

<b>2004-10-26 ANOTHER SECURITY HOLE, fixed in PuTTY 0.56</b>

<p>PuTTY 0.56, released today, fixes a
<b><a href="wishlist/vuln-ssh2-debug.html">serious security hole</a></b>
which can allow a server to execute code of its choice on a PuTTY
client connecting to it. In SSH2, the attack can be performed
<em>before host key verification</em>, meaning that even if you
trust the server you <em>think</em> you are connecting to, a
different machine could be impersonating it and could launch the
attack before you could tell the difference. We recommend
<em>everybody</em> upgrade to 0.56 as soon as possible.

<p>That's two really bad holes in three months. I'd like to apologise to
all our users for the inconvenience.
